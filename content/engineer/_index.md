      title: Dynamics LK (Pvt) Ltd

        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          Dynamics LK began as a passion project envisioned by me and my close colleague and fellow researcher, Mr. Chanuka Lihini Tennakoon. The idea emerged during a challenging period in our undergraduate years in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, when we sought freelance work to support ourselves financially. Unlike the typical freelancing trends at the time, we made a deliberate decision to focus exclusively on mechanical engineering design and analysis.
          <br/><br/>
          Although the early stages were difficult, we gradually earned the trust of a small group of clients who returned with repeat projects. Their confidence in our work helped us build a strong professional reputation as freelance mechanical engineers. Encouraged by this growing client base, we began to consider the possibility of forming a fully dedicated mechanical engineering research and development company.
          <br/><br/>
          With the support and collaboration of two additional colleagues, Mr. Chamith Udagedara and Mr. Ravisha Serasinghe, we formally established Dynamics LK (Pvt) Ltd on 20 January 2020.
          <br/><br/>
          Each of the four founding members brought expertise in a distinct area of mechanical engineering, enabling us to deliver solutions to a diverse range of technically challenging projects. Our approach, rooted not only in engineering practice but also in rigorous research methodology, provided us with a unique advantage. By combining academic problem-solving discipline with practical engineering execution, we successfully supported both local and international clients with some of their most demanding mechanical engineering challenges.
          <br/><br/>
          Brief descriptions of a selection of our completed projects are provided below, noting that some details cannot be shared due to non-disclosure agreements.
