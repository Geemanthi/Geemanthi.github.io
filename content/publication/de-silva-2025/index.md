abstract: Investigations into aerodynamic forces and flow characteristics around scale models are among the most common applications of wind tunnel testing. However, novice investigators often face significant challenges in acquiring the comprehensive knowledge needed to conduct these investigations successfully. They are typically required to navigate through extensive textbooks and other resources, which can lead to confusion about the initial steps and the optimal procedures to follow. To address these challenges, this work proposes an innovative framework which organizes the experimental investigation process into three key stages: Pre-Test, Test, and Post-Test. Each stage encompasses essential steps designed to ensure a systematic, thorough, and effective investigation. This structured approach aims to streamline the workflow for novice investigators, improve efficiency, and reduce the likelihood of errors. By providing clear guidance and a logical progression of tasks, the framework enables investigators to build confidence and achieve reliable results. The publication focuses specifically on aerodynamic investigations conducted in small to mediumsized low-speed wind tunnels, as these are the most commonly used facilities by novice researchers. By tailoring the framework to their needs, this work seeks to serve as a practical guide, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on experimental expertise.
summary: Investigations into aerodynamic forces and flow characteristics around scale models are among the most common applications of wind tunnel testing. However, novice investigators often face significant challenges in acquiring the comprehensive knowledge needed to conduct these investigations successfully.
