abstract: Birds change the shape of their wings mid-flight to alter their aerodynamic characteristics. Through such wing-morphing movements, they achieve impressive efficiency and agility. Inspired by these highly evolved biomechanics of bird wings, a seres of projects have been carried out to investigate methods of mimicking the morphing wings of birds and the changes in aerodynamic performance caused by such morphing movements. With a better understanding of the aerodynamic effects, morphing wings can be used to improve the aerodynamic performance of future Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
