I am a Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My expertise is in fluid dynamics, with strong experience in both computational and experimental methods. I teach across Aeronautical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering Design, and take great satisfaction in mentoring students on curricular and extracurricular projects. In addition to my academic role, I am an entrepreneur and consultant mechanical engineer, having worked with both Sri Lankan and international clients on research and development projects that deliver innovative solutions to fluid dynamics and broader engineering challenges. My long-term vision is to strengthen collaboration between academia and industry to develop sustainable, practical solutions that address the future challenges of humankind.
